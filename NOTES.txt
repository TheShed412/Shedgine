I think I need to come up with a process for loading textures on my own.

I am having issues with textures and OBJ files.
1. The mtl file blender (or even downloaded objs) provide never link to provided texture files.
    - if I do add it manually, it will load the texture
    - though this leads to issue 2
2. When I do get the texture loaded, it is completely wrong
    - blender cuts up the texture and pastes it around the model, I seem to be able to wrap it and that's it

I guess the plan will be to make the objs seperate from the textures, and load them seperately.
This will need an interesting work flow for model makers I'll need to figure out

I am able to load textures and apply them independently. I can load that wood texture and apply it to like any model I load.
What is weird, is the texcoords in the obj file works. So like. I dunno.

We are moving on to just making a game. First I need to figure out lighting, then I'm going to make some
models, and from there just make a simple star fox clone
